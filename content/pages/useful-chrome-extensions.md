A few Chrome extensions I find useful

* [Go to tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goto-tab/hjfkaobgkmaeomgdhmhhipdbjdhhjkoi) (when you have lots of open tabs)

* [The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg) (when those tabs consume too many resources)
